What is API?
- Application Programming Interface
- Contract provided by one piece of software to another
- Structured request and response
- We just worked with an API that takes a request and respond with jokes

What is REST API?
1)	Representational state transfer
2)	Architectural style for designing network application
3)	Relies on a stateless, client-server protocol, almost always https
4)	Treats server onjects as resources that can be created or destroyed
5)	Can be used virtually any programming language
6)	All api's have their own rules and structures
7)	If an api is restfull then it must contains http methods like put/get/post/delte/update

REST API Main Methods
1) GET: Retrieve data grom a specified resource
2) POST: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource
3) PUT: Update a specified resource
4) DELETE: Delete a specified resource

OPTIONALS
- HEAD: Same as get but does not return a body
- OPTIONS: Returns the supported HTTP methods
- PATCH: Update partial resources

API Endpoints
